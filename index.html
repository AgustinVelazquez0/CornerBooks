        <h1>Hermes Trismegisto-El Kybalion.</h1>
        <p>The Emerald Tablet, a work attributed to the mythical Hermes Trismegistus, the thrice great, is a text written by a master hand where in an impressive synthesis he exposes the secrets of the divine primordial substance and the possibilities of its transmutation. In a cryptic, enigmatic writing, one finds the most concise and precious summary for those who wish to access alchemical knowledge. These teachings, in ancient times, were reserved for a few scholars and therefore were considered secret for a long time. At the beginning of the 20th century, a small group of scholars of these esoteric doctrines set out to make them known to the entire world and to do so they created a work based on the knowledge that emerges from this work, giving shape to The Kybalion. The authors preferred to remain anonymous and therefore used the pseudonym "Three Initiates."
            The divine primordial substance alluded to in the book refers to the fundamental element that makes up the different planes of existence: the physical, the astral and the mental. And it is precisely this last one, the Mental Plane, where humans can develop all our potential for transmutation. This self-transformation is achieved by understanding the bases of Mental Alchemy developed in the axioms (The seven Universal Laws) described in The Kybalion.
            The objective of these teachings is the supreme degree of human perfection through Mental Alchemy.
            It is based on the premise that the human being is an inseparable part of the Universe and the Universe is part of him, this uniqueness allows women and men of the earth to integrate with the divinity that has created them.</p>

<p>In this work, Viktor Frankl explains the experience that led him to
    discovery of logotherapy. Prisoner for a long time in the
    concentration camps, he himself felt in his own being what it meant
    a naked existence. How could he - who had lost everything, who
    had seen everything worthwhile destroyed, who suffered hunger, cold,
    endless brutalities, which so many times came close to extermination -, how
    Could he accept that life was worth living? The doctor's words
    Frankl reach a surprisingly hopeful mood about the
    human capacity to transcend its difficulties and discover the truth
    convenient and guiding.</p>

        <h1>Las 48 leyes del poder-Robert Greene.</h1>
        <p>Robert Greene details the laws of power in their crudest essence, synthesizing the thought of Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, Carl von Clausewitz and other great theorists and strategists. Some laws suggest prudence (“Law No. 1: Never overshadow your love"); others, stealth (“Law No. 3: disguise your intentions”); others, a complete lack of mercy (“Law No. 15: Completely crush your enemy”). But, whether we like it or not, they all have applications in everyday life. Illustrated by anecdotes of Elizabeth II, Henry Kissinger, P.T. Barnum and other figures who have wielded power (or who have suffered from it), these laws will fascinate anyone interested in all the manifestations of total control.</p>

        <h1>Rebelión en la granja-George Orwell.</h1>
        <p>Man is the only being that consumes without producing. It does not give milk, it does not lay eggs, it is too weak to pull the plow and its speed does not even allow it to catch rabbits. However, he is the owner and lord of all the animals. He makes them work, gives them the minimum necessary to support them and keeps the rest for himself. Our work tills the land, our manure fertilizes it, and yet there is not one of us who owns anything more than his skin. You cows who are here, how many thousands of liters of milk have you given this last year? And what has been done with that milk that was supposed to be used to raise robust calves? Every last drop has gone to the palates of our enemies. And you chickens, how many eggs have you laid this year and how many chicks have hatched from those eggs? Everything else has gone into the market to make money for Jones and his people.</p>

            <h1>1984-George Orwell.</h1>
             <p>1984 is the most famous anti-utopia or dystopia of all
                They were written during the first half of the 20th century. In her,
                Orwell presents a future in which a totalitarian dictatorship
                interferes to such an extent in the private lives of citizens that
                It is impossible to escape its control. Winston's odyssey
                Smith in a London dominated by Big Brother and the party
                can only be interpreted as a criticism of any dictatorship,
                although in the analogies with Stalinist communism they are
                evident, given the author's life history. The novel charges
                new validity in today's society, in which the control of
                citizens, coercive or not, is more perfected than in
                no other moment in the history of Humanity. Finally,
                We will see the influence of the work on the culture of the 20th century, both
                in its literary and cinematographic aspects.</p>

            <p>A general approach to the Syntergic Theory conceived, systematized and proposed by the Mexican psychophysiologist and philosopher Jacobo Grinberg Zylberbaum, who investigated on the nature of experience and consciousness, and who approached such question from diverse paradigms and horizons, from neurophysiology to the shamanic understanding of existence. Grinberg’s work is a milestone for philosophy and science; his methodology is constituted by elements of positive science, insofar his approach is quantitative, objective and from the third-person perspective, as well as elements of a qualitative, subjective and first-person perspective, mainly from the phenomenology of experience and perception.</p>

        <h1>La Conquista del Templo-Jacobo Grinberg.</h1>
        <p>Stories, memories, trips to exotic lands, gurus and spiritual experiences. Everything comes together to make this narrative a shared and enriching experience. There is a colloquial and communicative tone that seduces from the first page, and leads us to an internal identification with the author. We will travel through the magical and painful universe of childhood and adolescence, we will grow with the initiatory experience of sex and love, and we will penetrate the whirlwind of the world and the search for meaning as conscious adults. Our era is dizzying, full of lights and shadows, of enlightened people, endearing madmen and prophets of disaster drowned in despair. Where is the world going? Where do we ourselves go? An intimate, tender and truthful story, The Conquest of the Temple immerses us in the paths and searches that only conclude with the discovery of oneself. Destiny and personal history often travel through crisscrossing paths and circular labyrinths. But through the skein of experiences and dreams, fearsome characters, setbacks and encounters with angelic beings, there is the thread that always leads us to a return to the sources, to the inner Temple.</p>

        <p>This work presents us with one of Carl G. Jung's main and most controversial themes: the problem of the collective unconscious and the principles and patterns of its activity. The volume also contains an essay in which Jung offers us some theoretical considerations on the nature of the psychic as well as an attempt to synthesize the multiple facets of his thought. To do this, he takes, as a starting point, the last and most daring of his hypotheses, that of the nature of the archetype. In his work as a whole, this essay occupies a place comparable to that of Outline of Psychoanalysis in Freud's work, insofar as both texts contain an exposition of their respective doctrines.</p>
